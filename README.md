# Album a day

This is a music tracking website for listening to albums. You can listen to one album a day and rate it. The stack is SvelteKit, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Drizzle, and SQLite. The music source is the Spotify API.

This is the second attempt of the project. The first attempt was using NextJS and the MusicBrainz API with Redis as a database.

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
bun run build
```

You can preview the production build with `bun run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
